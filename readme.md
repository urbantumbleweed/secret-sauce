##Implementation
Secret Sauce is built with on Rails with a PostgreSQL database. See sample code below. It uses RESTful and custom routes to deliver the educational track experience and allow users to quickly reference important pages. Backbone.js and D3 were implemented to enliven the user experience through animations and in-page quizzes.

Custom routes for the positions controller:
```ruby
class PositionsController < ApplicationController
	before_filter :authenticate_user!


	def index
		@positions = Position.all
	end

	def position
		@position = Position.find_by_shortname(params[:position])
		@page = Page.find_by_shortname(params[:page])
		current_user.update_completion(@position, @page)
	end

	def next
		track = params[:track]		
		page = Page.find_by_shortname(params[:page])
		position = Position.find(params[:position])
		page = position.next_page(page)
		if page == nil
			redirect_to agreement_path
		else
			redirect_to "/#{track}/#{position.shortname}/#{page.shortname}" 
		end
	end

	def agreement
		if current_user.agreed == true
			redirect_to root_path
		end
	end

	def agree
		current_user.agreed = true
		current_user.save!
		redirect_to thanks_path
	end

	def skill
		skill = params['shortname']
		render "positions/skills/#{skill}"
	end

	def skills
		redirect_to "/#{current_user.track}/#{current_user.position.shortname}/extra_skills" 
	end


end
```


RSpec tests for the User model:
```ruby
 describe "after viewing all the photographer pages" do
        before do
          @position.pages.all.each do |page|
            @user.update_completion(@position, page)
          end
        end
        it "last page should be nil" do
          @user.last_page.should === @position.pages.last
        end
        
        it "should have finished the track" do
          @user.should be_finished_track
        end

        it "current page should be the status's last page" do
          @user.current_page.should == @position.pages.first
        end

      end
```
