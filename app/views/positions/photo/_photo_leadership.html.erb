    <p>As Photo Director, you’re in charge of maintaining the aesthetic quality of the site. The photos on the site reflect your work, so if there’s something you don’t love, ask the photographer to reshoot, or take the post down altogether. Here are some tips to maintaining a healthy photo team:</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-3"><h4>LEAD PHOTO WORKSHOPS.</h4>
        Ask photogs to bring cameras to a meeting and: (1) Talk about best settings (2) Critique existing photos (3) Practice! Bring food photograph it. (4) Say what’s good and bad <em>in the moment</em> (5) Do a photo editing demo.</div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"><h4>MAKE AND PRINT A CHEAT SHEET FOR YOUR TEAM.</h4>
          Keep track of who isn’t meeting their deadlines, and follow up with them. Ask why. Let them know you’re watching. It could include photo tips and camera settings.

        <div class="col-sm-3"><h4>ORGANIZE PHOTO SHOOTS.</h4>
          Come up with a few content/feature ideas, rent out a space with great lighting, have everyone bring props and take photos all day! You can knock out a bunch of photos for stories in one long sitting.

        <div class="col-sm-3"><h4>HAVE INCREDIBLE COMMUNICATION.</h4>
          Respond to emails quickly, get everyone’s phone numbers so you can text them in a pinch. You set the communication standard.</div>
          <div class="col-sm-3"><h4>BE NICE, BUT BE STERN.</h4>
           The #1 regret from our early chapters was that they didn’t set expectations from the start, and people thought Spoon was a blow off club. Make sure everyone knows Spoon is a commitment.
         </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"><h4>GIVE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK.</h4>
          Praise your photographers if they put up some incredible photos, and give constructive criticism on those photos that aren’t so good.</div>
          <div class="col-sm-3"><h4>HAVE BONDING EVENTS (OVER FOOD OF COURSE).</h4>
            Organize a potluck for the photo team, and take lots of pictures!
