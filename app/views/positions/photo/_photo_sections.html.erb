        Need photographs of every single step of the process. Two photos of the final dish are mandatory, one for the feature photo (landscape orientation) and one for the end of the post. Take tons of photos, all with natural light, so editors can choose the best.

        Must have photos of the interior, exterior and dishes with the names of each dish in the caption. You don’t have to spend money — take photos of food as it comes out of the kitchen, ask a patron if you could snap a photo, or set up a press dinner to get a free tasting and take pics of every dish.

          Each article must have an original feature photo and a handful of photos in-text. If the post is a long list, suggest using other related photos from Spoon, with proper photo credit.

          How-to articles must have photos of every step of the process. Guides should have several photos of the food (eg. the different types, sizes, colors, shapes, etc.). Take photos at a grocery store if you don&#8217;t have items on hand.
