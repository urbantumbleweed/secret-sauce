      Nice depth including the bite — makes the photo more interesting and complex.

      Great perspective with awesome colors. Ask the restaurant to play with the light switches, if possible, and maybe find a wide-angle lens for interior shots (borrow one!).

      Clean, white plate, thoughtfully placed apples, and the dripping honey is a fantastic detail.

      We’re not sure what this is — it needs context, and it needs no flash, and it needs to look less like a ball.Sometimes food looks better if you do less, and this is one of those times.

      This is framed too tightly. These cookies had mad potential, but the flash ruined them :(

      The cutting board is the same color as the food, which makes the photos much less interesting! But what do you do if your cutting board happens to be the same color as the food? You don’t use the cutting board in the photo. Or you borrow your neighbor’s.

      Way too orange — this should be color balanced.

      This is so over-saturated that the colors are blown out. Photos with colors are awesome, but too much of anything can be bad.

      There are many distracting background elements in this photo. That spoon handle jutting out of the top left needs to be moved. And be careful just showing part of the spoon dripping honey from the top. The chair in the background should have been moved as well.
