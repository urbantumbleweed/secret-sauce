When you’re not throwing big events, plan other, smaller things throughout the semester to engage students on campus.
Just to get the good thoughts rollin’ around in your head:
BAKE SALE
Make recipes from Spoon site, hand out recipe cards and charge $$ per treat

BANANAGRAM
Buy bananas in bulk. Write a message and your school’s URL on each banana and hand them out.

HOLIDAY TREAT
Hand out free candies with Spoon sticker/note attached.

WARM UP
Set up table and sell $1 hot chocolate or Starbucks coffee in the winter.

FAN FARE
Set up a booth at sporting event/multicultural event; hand out fliers with healthy eating tips relevant to the event.

SMARTIES
Estimation box: make box of little candies, have people guess and winner gets candy.

POTLUCK
Plan a party where everyone brings a dish.

VOLUNTEER
Organize canned food drive, set up boxes in dorms to collect leftover food before breaks, volunteer at soup kitchen, etc.

CHOCOLATE-DIPPED
Dip spoons in melted chocolate and then give them away (for email addresses!)

TIME LAPSE
Set up a big whiteboard/poster and film people writing things (their favorite food?) then make a timelapse video.

USE THE SYSTEM
Partner with dining services and have them make Spoon recipes.

GET FANCY
Pair up with a fancy restaurant in town and have students sign up for a discounted pre-fixe meal (see Northwestern)

SPEAK
Organize speakers (experts, nutritionists, professors, chefs, etc.).

IT’S A MIRACLE

SPOON SWAG
Buy Spoon merchandise or apparel to sell, give away, or raffle.

WINDOW SHOPPING
