<p class="label">STEP 1</p><br>
<h4>FIND FREE SPACE</h4>
<p>It has to be <strong>big enough</strong> to hold a lot of people, <strong>close enough</strong> so people are willing to go. Ideally a place that students are familiar with.</p>

<p class="label">STEP 2</p><br>
<h4>FOOD</h4>
<p>If you’re trying to get free food, start early. Email, call and visit restaurants <strong>(yes, all three)</strong> to request donations for the launch event. Tell them it’ll be great for business Be relentless, and get a ton of food.</p>
<p></strong>strong>No one wants to give you food?</strong> Suggest they set up a booth at the event and charge students $1-$5 for bites.</p>

  <div class="timeline-step">
<p class="label">STEP 3</p><br>
<h4>TICKETS</h4>
<p>Sell tickets before the event for a discounted price and <strong>at the door for slightly more</strong>. To avoid free food hoarders, give each person 2 food tickets at the door. They can get 2 free food items, and if they want more food they have to go back to the front to purchase more tickets.</p>
