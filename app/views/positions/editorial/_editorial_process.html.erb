<h1>Editing Process</h1>


Scroll to the right to learn how a story flows through the system, from ideation to publishing



STEP 1

A writer comes up with an amazing story idea and emails the assigned editor for approval.

STEP 2

Editor approves (or disapproves) idea, and writer immediately contacts their photographer to coordinate photos for the article.

STEP 3

Writer researches and writes the story and posts the story to WordPress. At the same time, the photographer uploads the photos to Flickr.

STEP 4

The writer takes the photos they want from Flickr and inserts them into their article. Sets featured image.

STEP 5

The writer notifies the copyeditor that the story is ready to go, and the copyeditor edits for grammar, obvious mistakes and things that just don’t make sense.

STEP 6

The story moves on to the managing editor or editor-in-chief. They confirm that the story will be a hit, make necessary edits, and refines the title and subtitle to be killer. If the story has major issues, it’s sent back to writer.

STEP 7

When the story looks good, the EIC publishes to the site and the writer promotes it on social media.
