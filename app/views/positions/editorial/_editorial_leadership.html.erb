	<p>As Editor-in-Chief, the buck stops with you. Content is boring? Find examples and inspire your writers. Photos aren’t good? Tell people to fix them. Titles suck? Set up a title workshop. Above all, you’re the glue that holds the team together. Here are tips on how to maintain a cohesive group:</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>SET THE BAR HIGH.</h4>
			You set the standard. You must be the most detail-oriented, reliable, timely person on the team — everyone else will follow suit.</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>HAVE INCREDIBLE COMMUNICATION.</h4>
			Respond to emails quickly, get everyone’s phone numbers so you can text them in a pinch. If you’re behind, everyone is.</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>SET DEADLINES AND STICK TO THEM.</h4>
			Keep track of who isn’t meeting their deadlines, and follow up with them. Ask why. Let them know you’re watching.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>ORGANIZE BONDING EVENTS.</h4>
			Make sure everyone knows each other and feels comfortable on the team. Host potlucks! Go out to dinner together!</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>BE NICE, BUT BE STERN.</h4>
			The #1 regret from our early chapters was that they didn’t set expectations from the start, and people thought Spoon was a blow off club. Make sure everyone knows Spoon is a commitment.</div>
		<div class="col-sm-4"><h4>GIVE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK.</h4>
			Let writers know when they’ve written a great article. Let them know if you want them to take a new direction. People will appreciate your honesty.</div>
